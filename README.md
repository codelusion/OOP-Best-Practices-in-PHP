# PHP-BDD-OOP-Sample
Sample PHP Cart application using BDD/OOP
  This is the code I used to illustrate the basics of OOP principles and best practices.
  Illustrates:
  - Encapsulation with Setters and Getters vs exposing Class internals
  - Self-validating Object instances, rather than validations sprinkled throughout code
  - Interfaces and type-hinting to reduce runtime exceptions
  - Writing classes with extension in mind
